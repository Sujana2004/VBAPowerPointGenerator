# VBAPowerPointGenerator
Create a FULL Corporate Style PowerPoint Slide Deck based on Tables and Charts from Excel using Excel VBA. Automate the repetitive task of creating routine slide desks every month.

We will learn how to interact with PowerPoint and manipulate its slide from Excel using the PowerPoint Object library. Leverage the PowerPoint Slide Master to create Professional looking PowerPoint Slide Layout and then, create the slides using those templates.

We will do some setup in Excel to facilitate our end goal. Data will be saved within an Excel table, so that the data range is dynamic. Report will be static and based off formulas, so that we don't need to run VBA over it. Create a named Pivot Chart and use Page Filters to manipulate the view via VBA. Once, the setup is done, our macro will copy data onto the PowerPoint slides. 

We will also, build some logic to add dynamic commentary based off values from the Excel sheets. e.g. If variance is negative, we will add comments in the slides saying the Result is negative.
